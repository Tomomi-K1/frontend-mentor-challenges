## What I learned
- Do not put styling on <html> tag unless it's necessary.
- "alt" should be used to give the functional and contextualized label or description (rather than a visual description) and ending alt-text with punctuation is beneficial for screen reader since it will give a pause after the end of attribute sentence.
